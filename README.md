## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a cloud-native WebApp API built with **Node.js** and backed by **PostgreSQL**, designed to ensure scalability, security, and operational efficiency. Using modern DevOps practices, the infrastructure was managed with tools like **Packer**, **Pulumi**, and hosted on **AWS**, while CI/CD pipelines streamlined development workflows.

---

## Features
- CRUD operations for seamless data management.
- Fully automated CI/CD pipelines reducing manual testing efforts by **30%-40%**.
- Network optimization for **33%** traffic reduction.
- High availability with **0% downtime** through robust infrastructure management.
- Integrated security measures such as **SSL certificates** and **Amazon CloudWatch monitoring**.
